# GoSearch

I just love Go (err... Golang) so... This is the beginning of a new VSCode extension called GoSearch that will allow you to search for new packages and "go get" them from within VSCode. All of this is being enabled by this super cool guy that gave us [go-search](https://www.go-search.org). Once I make some more progress, I'm going to shout him out and give him all the kudos he deserves. This isn't anything but a dumb VSCode extension.

## Features

GoSearch allows you to search for Go packages via [go-search.org](https://www.go-search.org)

After you've found the package you want, you can use the context menu to "go get" the package.

I'll add some screenshots here (in the gibberish area) once I get further along.

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow. (GAHH!!! HOW DO YOU DO ANIMATIONS?!?!?)

## Requirements

The version of Go you have installed will dictate the version of the Go package you are trying to install.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

It still sucks because it isn't feature complete just yet :)
